## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

Working on this project not only refresh my memory on coding and styling because have been away from coding for the past few month. The area i would like to improve more is on the font-face of the prototype i found it getting the actual fonts. Nevertheless i'm excited working on Front-end Mentor beginners project.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: cyan;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

The area i would like to improve on is the flexbox and flex on css, i find it hard to flex word properly 


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.google.com) - This helped me for fonts reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3school.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand some totorials on css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
